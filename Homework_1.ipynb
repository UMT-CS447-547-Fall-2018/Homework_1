    "The procecutor points out that there is a .01 chance the defendent has the guilty blood type. However, he incorrectly claims that the inverse probablity applies to the prosecutor's guilt since he has the blood type. In reality all that has been proven is that it is *possible* that the defendent is guilty since he lies within the popupation of the universe with the rare blood type. Without any other evidence the correct probability could very well be represented as $\\frac{1}{population of the universe with the rare blood type}$.\n"

    "One use of the naive Bayes classifier, which is still in practical use today, is as a spam filter.  Consider the corpus of text messages packaged with this homework, which are each labelled as either 'spam' or 'ham'.  In this case, naive Bayes utilizes a Bernoulli model that quantifies the probability of a given word given that the message is either spam or ham.  For example, investigating the text messages here, we find that the word *draw* shows up in spam 27 times, yet in ham only 5.  Thus, we have that\n",

I have also parsed a set of test data: *test_messages* is a list, each entry containing another list of the words in the text message, as well as *test_labels* which contains the spam/ham label for each message."
