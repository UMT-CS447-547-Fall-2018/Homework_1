For this $P(A|B) = P(B|A)$ to be true , $P(A)=P(B)$ must also be true, but that is not the case. However, Bayes Theorem states $P(A|B)=P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)$. So, the actual probability that the defendent is guilty we need to know how many people had access to the crime scene, which will affect $P(A=guilt)$. For example, if all 800,000 people of the city have visited the crime scene, the defendents chances of guilt would be $0.0125$%.\n",

Using the same Bayes equation as above we find that $P(A|B)=P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)$. When we solve this equation as we did above we get the same answer of $0.0125$% chance of guilt as opposed to $0.000125$% chance of guilt as would be true with the argument of the defense.

    "One use of the naive Bayes classifier, which is still in practical use today, is as a spam filter.  Consider the corpus of text messages packaged with this homework, which are each labelled as either 'spam' or 'ham'.  In this case, naive Bayes utilizes a Bernoulli model that quantifies the probability of a given word given that the message is either spam or ham.  For example, investigating the text messages here, we find that the word *draw* shows up in spam 27 times, yet in ham only 5.  Thus, we have that\n",

I have also parsed a set of test data: *test_messages* is a list, each entry containing another list of the words in the text message, as well as *test_labels* which contains the spam/ham label for each message."
