    "Say V is the event that the defendent is guilty (1) or innocent (0), and that E is the event that the defendent has the blood type (1) or not (0). Prosecutor's fallacy falsely claims that $P(E|V) = P(V|E)$. When actually, $P(E|V) = \\frac{P(V|E)P(E)}{P(V)}$. In other words, the fallacy ignores the probability of the defendent being guilty independent of the blood evidence, $P(V)$, and the probability of having the rare blood type independent of the verdict, $P(E)$. The former being an issue because it ignores all other evidence, while the latter is important to consider the magnitude having the rare blood at all compared to having the rare blood only if guilty."

    "If there is an established $P(V=1)$ from the other evidence, presumably the evidence has already influenced $P(V=1)$ (possibly very far) away from the notion that $\\textit{anyone}$ in the city is guilty. The probability of an unlikely event matching one suspect is highly relevant when talking about a subset of the people in the city rather than the whole group at large, since it is less likely for a random group of 10, for example, to have someone who happens to have the blood type. Regardless, even with no prior evidence the blood test would still be \"relevant\" because it would narrow the prior from 1/800000 to 1/8000."

    "One use of the naive Bayes classifier, which is still in practical use today, is as a spam filter.  Consider the corpus of text messages packaged with this homework, which are each labelled as either 'spam' or 'ham'.  In this case, naive Bayes utilizes a Bernoulli model that quantifies the probability of a given word given that the message is either spam or ham.  For example, investigating the text messages here, we find that the word *draw* shows up in spam 27 times, yet in ham only 5.  Thus, we have that\n",

I have taken the somewhat tedious step of parsing the data for you, yielding the variables *word_dictionary*, which contains the ham and spam counts for each word, as well as *training_labels*, which provides the spam/ham labels for each text message.  I have also parsed a set of test data: *test_messages* is a list, each entry containing another list of the words in the text message, as well as *test_labels* which contains the spam/ham label for each message."
